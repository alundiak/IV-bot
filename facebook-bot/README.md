# NLP

- [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/)

> Dialogflow (once known as [API.AI](https://api.ai/)) is a service owned by Google that allows developers to build speech to text, natural language processing and artificially intelligent systems that you can train with your own custom functionality.

- [Wit.ai](https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit)

> Wit.ai (owned by Facebook) works similarly to Dialogflow: it also processes human speech patterns and filters useful data like intent and context from it.
