## Idea

Bot will provide a quiz with questions. Interview Person should provide `type` of quiz: `JavaScript`, `React`, `Java`, `TBD`. Then start answering questions. Bot will analyze answers and give feedback right away. Logic for making decision is very easy - only one question is correct, and Bot is programmed to know it, and if user reply is the same as. expected by Bot - then question is passed (OK).


## Tech Stack
- This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it's a simple echo bot with state.
- Bot logic hosted in NodeJS-like server, using [`restify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify).
- Main code written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) >= `v3.1.x`.

## Deployment
- Easy: Bot logic can be hosted in either local network as available host, or dedicated computer or any public free host. Not much of efforts needed, it's just quiz-like behavior.
- Complex: Bot can be hosted on Heroku, but some delays can be in responses, then we need to use Cafeinne app, which will cause Heroku later on to suspend Heroku account.
- Complicated: Bot can be hosted od MS dedicated Azure service. But it can be paid with time.
